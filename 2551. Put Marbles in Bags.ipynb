    "# 2551. Put Marbles in Bags\n",
    "\n",
    "You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "No bag is empty.\n",
    "If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.\n",
    "If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].\n",
    "The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. \n",
    "The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. \n",
    "Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. \n",
    "Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.\n",
