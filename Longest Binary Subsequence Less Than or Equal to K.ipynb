    "# Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.\n",

    "\n",
    "The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.\n",
    "The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.\n",
    "A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"1001010\", k = 5\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is \"00010\", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.\n",
    "Note that \"00100\" and \"00101\" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.\n",
    "The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"00101001\", k = 1\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: \"000001\" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.\n",
    "The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.\n",
