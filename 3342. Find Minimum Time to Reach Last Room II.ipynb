    "# 3342. Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.\n",

    "You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between adjacent rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, alternating between the two.\n",
