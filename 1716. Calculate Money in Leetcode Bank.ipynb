    "# 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.\n",

    "Output: 10\n",
    "Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n",
