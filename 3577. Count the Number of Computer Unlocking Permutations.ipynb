    "# 3577. Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations\n",

    "There are n locked computers in a room with labels from 0 to n - 1, each with its own unique password. The password of the computer i has a complexity complexity[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "The password for the computer labeled 0 is already decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can decrypt the password for the computer i using the password for computer j, where j is any integer less than i with a lower complexity. (i.e. j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i])\n",
    "To decrypt the password for computer i, you must have already unlocked a computer j such that j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i].\n",
