The array is initialized with base values at the appropriate indices, such as dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1. Then, we iteratively calculate Fibonacci values from dp[2] to dp[n] by using the relation dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]. This allows us to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers in a loop. Finally, the value at dp[n] gives the Fibonacci number for the input n, as each index holds the answer for its corresponding Fibonacci number."
